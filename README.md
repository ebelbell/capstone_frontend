# Recipe App

## Description

Recipe API manages recipes using CRUD operations. This app is intended for users who may have or know someone with allergies. They can use this app to search a recipe and find a food item's description and allergy information. 

## Tech-Use

* Imports: MongoDB, Express, Node.js, axios
* I used Schemas to define my Recipe models. This allowed me to interact with the Recipe collection in MongoDB.
