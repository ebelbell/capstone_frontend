      <p>Recipe API manages recipes using CRUD operations. 
        This app is intended for users 
        <br/>who may have or know someone with allergies. 
        <br/>They can use this app to search a recipe and find a food item's description and allergy information. 
      </p>
      * Imports: MongoDB, Express, Node.js, axios
      <br/> * I used Schemas to define my Recipe models. This allowed me to interact <br/>with the Recipe collection in MongoDB.
